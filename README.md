# password-generator-W2D4
A password generator project for Week 2, Day 4

This generates a password tailored to the user's needs. It has options for different character sets, and certain specific lengths.

The user clicks the button, and is presented with a series of prompts to determine the properties of their new password. This includes character length (8-128), as well as the use of lowercase, uppercase, numeric, or special characters. If at least one set of characters is selected, a password will be generated, and displayed on the page for the user.
